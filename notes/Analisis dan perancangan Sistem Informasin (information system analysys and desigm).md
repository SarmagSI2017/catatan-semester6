# Analisis dan perancangan Sistem Informasin (information system analysys and desigm)

## Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION
 
 Information system Development has 2 steps:

 ### What is Information SYstem?:
  - a system which consist of integrated or set of component which has a value of its information and such information is useful for people.

### The Information 
- component (?)
- data
- people
- procedure
- software
- hardware
- network

the goal of IS is produce a good informatiom

### Why do you need information: 
- to make  a decision.

### Information criteria
- timelines
- accurate
- relevant to the user.

### Why we need IS?
  - The problem do exists = in IS, the indication is complaint
  - The Opportunities = to take the opportunities to adopt the newest technologies.
  - The directives = follow the intruction

  Current System --> (There is a prob, oppourtu, directi)--> System developemnt --> (solved 3 things above) --> New System

### System Developemnt Life Cycle: john geobroker (?)
1. Policy & Planning: 
    A mechanism in order to achieve something by fullfilling the requirement you need in order to reach your target

    set of plan:
    - timelining
    - Resources in Development

2. System Analysis: 
    Diagnosis the system (rip my english) and understanding the system, knowing the problem, all of them need to be defined both problems and requirement. The result of this is SRS (system requirement spesification).

3. General Design:

4. Evaluation and selection
5. Detail Design = deciding th design + programming language
6. System implementation = the develop of software
7. Maintanance  = fix and bugs, GOTO STEAP 1.

nOte: 
Operation --> Transaction Processing System = do stuff
Middle --> Management Information System = generate a report
Qualitas = memenuhi kriteria yang sudah ditetapkan agar memenuhi standart yang ingin dicapai.
